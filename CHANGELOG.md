# Changelog

## [0.1.1] - 2026-10-08

- Introduce durable job metadata with one-shot and recurring schedules, bounded
  retries, pending cancellation and explicit uncertain-effect reconciliation.
- Add validated record reconstruction, a persistence example and an optional
  IC Timers watchdog adapter.
- Provide package verification, publication dry runs and a separate crates.io
  upload command for clean releases with matching pushed annotated tags.
- Include regular README and license files in the crate package, supporting
  packaged rustdoc and the repository's pre-commit formatting snapshot.
- Keep release fixture checks independent of the shell locale, and report the
  failing source line when a tooling check fails.

This is the first proposed standard patch release from the initial unpublished
workspace version 0.1.0; no finalized release history exists.
