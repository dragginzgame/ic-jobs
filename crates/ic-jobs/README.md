# IC Jobs

Durable job metadata and scheduling policies for Internet Computer applications.
Applications own persistence, effects and IC Timers integration; IC Jobs
validates metadata transitions and selects due work from bounded iterators.

## Use

```rust
use ic_jobs::{Job, JobId, Outcome, RetryPolicy, Schedule};

let mut job = Job::new(
    JobId(1),
    Schedule::Once { at_ns: 100 },
    RetryPolicy::NONE,
);
let attempt = job.start(100)?;
// Persist job.record() and the immutable payload before dispatching the effect.
job.finish(attempt, 101, Outcome::Success)?;
// Persist job.record() again after recording the result.
# Ok::<(), ic_jobs::JobError>(())
```

Times are absolute IC nanoseconds supplied by the application. A due timestamp
is an eligibility threshold, not a punctual-execution guarantee.

The crate supports one-shot deadlines, fixed-rate intervals, recurrence after
completion, missed-run policies, bounded retries, pending cancellation and exact
attempt correlation. Persist the canonical `JobRecord` beside the application
payload and reconstruct it through `Job::restore`.

Validated `Job` values implement `Serialize` transparently through the canonical
`JobRecord` writer, so application snapshots may serialize jobs directly.
`Job` has no `Deserialize` implementation: decode `JobRecord`, then call
`Job::restore` before using the job.

`pause` suspends pending work durably; `resume` restores its original deadline
and missed-run policy. `reschedule` replaces scheduling intent from an unstarted
occurrence forward, retaining job/effect identity and dispatch sequence. Paused
work stays paused, and cancellation accepts it. Rescheduling an attempted
occurrence refuses, including retry waiting. Running and Uncertain effects remain
blocked until explicit disposition. Management does not change payloads or retry
budgets. Commit each record and its due-time index before reconciling a timer.

## 0.16 stored-record hard cut

`JobState::Running` is a unit variant. For a running attempt, the dispatch time
is `JobRecord::updated_ns`; match `JobState::Running` without a timestamp field.
JSON encodes this state as `"Running"`. The previous
`{"Running":{"started_ns":100}}` shape is refused. Transitioning to
`Uncertain { started_ns }` preserves the original dispatch time before updating
the transition timestamp, including across later unresolved reconciliation.
Both states remain blocked after validated restoration.

`JobRecord::last_outcome` is `Option<RecordedOutcome>`: an outcome and its
`at_ns` timestamp are present together. Read them with
`record.last_outcome.map(|result| result.outcome)` and
`record.last_outcome.map(|result| result.at_ns)`. The separate
`last_outcome_ns` field is removed. Management preserves the complete latest
result; it cannot replace the result's timestamp with a later management time.

The JSON field is now `"last_outcome":{"outcome":"Success","at_ns":101}`,
or `"last_outcome":null` before any recorded outcome. Both fields inside a
recorded result are required. Retired serialized shapes are refused, including
records with the old `last_outcome_ns` field. There is one current codec and no
compatibility reader, converter or automatic reset.

The repository maintainer explicitly approved retiring earlier installations
without preserving their records for this cut. Consumers must retire/reset
earlier installations under their own authority and create fresh state before
adopting this format. Updating source or invoking restore never clears storage.
Current-format Running/Uncertain records still restore as blocked; only explicit
result or retry-safety evidence permits disposition through the Jobs API.

## Checked configuration

Recurring `Schedule` intervals use `std::num::NonZeroU64`; absolute deadlines
still use `u64` and may be zero. Build retry budgets with
`RetryPolicy::new(max_attempts, initial_delay_ns, max_delay_ns)?`, or use
`RetryPolicy::NONE`. Read the immutable values with `max_attempts()`,
`initial_delay_ns()` and `max_delay_ns()`.

```rust
use std::num::NonZeroU64;
use ic_jobs::{Job, JobId, RetryPolicy, Schedule};

let interval = NonZeroU64::new(10).unwrap();
let retry = RetryPolicy::new(3, 5, 20)?;
let job = Job::new(JobId(1), Schedule::AfterCompletion {
    first_at_ns: 0,
    every_ns: interval,
}, retry);
assert_eq!(job.next_due_ns(), Some(0));
# Ok::<(), ic_jobs::JobError>(())
```

Raw inputs must reject zero before constructing a schedule. Invalid retry
configuration returns `JobError::InvalidRetryPolicy`; invalid serialized
configuration fails decoding.
Every decoded `JobRecord` still passes through `Job::restore` to check its history.
Checked configuration does not grant admission to a retired record format.

## Scheduling a batch

`next_due_ns` reads a finite iterator of job references, and `start_next`
starts one earliest due attempt from an iterator of mutable job references.
Slices and vectors can still be supplied directly. They leave storage,
payload lookup, effect execution and completion persistence with the application.

```rust
use ic_jobs::{Job, JobId, RetryPolicy, Schedule, next_due_ns, start_next};

// Application-owned payloads stay beside the validated jobs.
let mut entries = [
    (Job::new(JobId(1), Schedule::Once { at_ns: 200 }, RetryPolicy::NONE), "later"),
    (Job::new(JobId(2), Schedule::Once { at_ns: 100 }, RetryPolicy::NONE), "first"),
];
assert_eq!(next_due_ns(entries.iter().map(|(job, _)| job)), Some(100));
if let Some((index, attempt)) = start_next(entries.iter_mut().map(|(job, _)| job), 100)? {
    assert_eq!(index, 1); // Position in this iterator, not a durable identity.
    assert_eq!(attempt.execution.job, JobId(2));
    let running_record = entries[index].0.record();
    // Commit running_record with entries[index].1 before dispatching the effect.
    // Record its outcome with the owning Job's finish method and persist again.
    # let _ = running_record;
}
# Ok::<(), ic_jobs::JobError>(())
```

Equal deadlines follow the supplied iterator order. Returned indexes refer to
that order, including when an iterator filters or reorders the source collection. A selected job's transition error
leaves every record unchanged; it does not select another job. Use a bounded
candidate batch from the application's due-time index. The reported deadline
covers only that batch; the storage owner supplies any wider queue's earliest
deadline to IC Timers.

A batch limit bounds one callback, not the entire catch-up backlog. For example,
86,400 pending one-second occurrences need at least 43,200 batches with a
two-attempt limit. Earliest-deadline selection can delay newer jobs until that
historical work drains. Prefer `Skip` for maintenance that does not need every
occurrence; use `CatchUp` only with an application-owned backlog/cycle budget.
This is a workload calculation, not a measured throughput or delivery guarantee.

A restored Running job remains Running. If its reply cannot be reconciled directly,
record Uncertain with the active attempt and use `resolve` only after establishing
the actual result or retry safety. A lost reply does not authorize another effect.
Uncertain effects block dispatch until
the application establishes the result or explicitly determines that repetition
is safe. `ExecutionId` identifies the logical effect across retries; `Attempt`
identifies one dispatch. Never reuse a job ID or change an occurrence's payload
under the same effect identity.

## Timer integration

Depend on IC Timers directly when the application needs wakeups. Applications own
the volatile watchdog, lifecycle initialization, bounded callbacks and any
consumer-owned asynchronous delivery continuation. This crate supplies no stable
storage, global queue, handler registry or exactly-once effects.

After committing records and due-time index changes, pass the earliest pending
deadline to `ic_timers::reconcile_watchdog`, mapping `None` to
`WatchdogReconcileState::Inactive` and a deadline to `ScheduledAt`. A bounded
callback returns `WatchdogRunResult::new` with its actual completion classification
and `WatchdogDecision::Stop` or `ScheduleAt` for the new deadline. Reconcile after job
insertion or management; after upgrades, restore all records and reconstruct the
watchdog synchronously before downstream hooks. Unresolved effects need a separate
application reconciliation workflow. Watchdog callbacks cannot await: external
delivery requires a persisted intent and consumer-owned continuation/outbox.

Timer completion classifies the dispatch callback, separately from each job's
effect outcome. A bounded batch can succeed while recording a known job failure
or preparing an external attempt whose result is still unknown. Report no work
for an empty batch. A watchdog recovery successor restores a callback opportunity;
it cannot make a permanently failing handler progress. Dispose of known no-effect
handler failures through the job's exact attempt, retaining fail-closed handling
for corrupt storage and unresolved external effects.

The qualification consumer uses IC Timers 0.23. Align timer dependencies and all
timer owners in the canister to that package identity. For exchanged measurement
summaries, use `ic_timers::MeasurementSummary` to share Timers' selected Metrics
package identity. Direct Metrics dependencies sharing those types must select 0.10.
Job records are unchanged; the application's chosen storage backend separately
owns physical-format compatibility and retained-installation disposition.

Timers publishes a new watchdog registration only after its requested
initial state succeeds. A failed first reconciliation leaves the consumer slot
empty and releases the new callback; retry can install the callback supplied
by that retry. Later failures retain existing authority. The instruction-summary
type selects Metrics 0.10; use the Timers re-export when exchanging summaries.

## 0.14 API cut

The two batch functions accept finite iterators of job references. Existing direct
slice/vector calls remain valid. Wrappers relying on implicit slice coercion
should pass an explicit slice or iterator; adapt code tied to the old function
signatures. Use `entries.iter().map(|entry| &entry.job)` for deadline
reads and the mutable projection for selection. The index belongs to that
iterator's order. This changes neither stored records nor transition semantics.

## 0.13 API cut

`start_next` returns `(index, attempt)`, updating the selected job in place.
Replace three-element tuple destructuring with the pair. Read
`jobs[index].record()` when preparing the durable intent, and commit it with the
immutable payload/index before dispatching any external effect. This signature
change does not change stored records, selection order, transitions or recovery.

## 0.11 API cut

Replace `Scheduler::new(&mut jobs).start_next(now)` with
`start_next(&mut jobs, now)` and use `next_due_ns(&jobs)` for deadline reads.
Remove `features = ["timers"]` from the Jobs dependency. Call IC Timers directly
as described above; the `ic_jobs::timers` module is removed. This cut preserves
the Jobs stored-record layout, job identities and transition behavior.

The package and its qualification consumer require Rust 1.91.
