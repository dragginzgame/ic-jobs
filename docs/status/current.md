# Current handoff

IC Jobs package version 0.1.1.
The library owns job policy and checked metadata transitions. Applications own
persistence and effects; the optional adapter uses IC Timers 0.14.19.

Core, persistence example, focused state/recovery tests and repository tooling
are implemented. Local Linux validation passed: 14 focused tests with the timer
adapter, Clippy with warnings denied, rustdoc and its example, the runnable
persistence example, and native/Wasm checks at Rust 1.85 core / Rust 1.88 timers.
The adopted snapshot and documentation links verify; release entrypoints passed
their substitute-runner check. Dependency declarations now pass against the
actual tracked lockfile. The complete validation-only release gate passed on
Linux with the locale repair before the 0.1.2 scheduler work. Live IC and native
macOS qualification remain pending.
The public GitHub repository `dragginzgame/ic-jobs` is configured as `origin`,
with authenticated HTTPS push credentials. The initial source is committed at
`da4a555`; the tooling repair is committed at `de61cd3`. The first release,
0.1.1, is tagged at `d5a2603` and the exact annotated tag is present on `origin`.
The retained release plan is complete. A current crates.io observation reports
`ic-jobs` 0.1.1 present; that observation alone does not bind registry bytes to
the local artifact.

Release and publication setup is committed. The Shared Tooling runner remains
at reviewed revision
`1872ed2c20f6c70689bb2249050b1d673c60bfa0`, with its annotated-tag and exact
crates.io observation helpers added to the snapshot. `make publish` separately
requires clean source, the matching pushed annotated tag and a confirmed absent
registry version. Pinned cargo-edit setup, package verification, publication dry
runs and configured CI coverage are available. Source changes must be committed
and Cargo credentials prepared before actual release/publication.

Focused Linux checks passed: real local Git patch/minor/major release fixtures,
failure before mutation, completed-release resume and publication refusals with
substitute gate/registry/upload effects, also under Bash 3.2. Cargo's actual
publication dry run verified the all-feature tarball without upload; rustdoc and
its example, native/Wasm Rust 1.85 core / Rust 1.88 timers, formatting, dependency
declarations, snapshot integrity and documentation links passed. The initial
tarball failure exposed a workspace-relative README include, now fixed with
crate-local README/license files. The initial symlink implementation was rejected
by pre-commit snapshot admission and replaced with a regular package guide and
license file. An offline publication dry run was refused by
Cargo's required HTTP observation; `publish-check` now explicitly uses registry
access. These passes do not establish native macOS or live publication evidence.

A maintainer invocation of `make release-patch` failed in the validation gate's
release fixture at its changed-path assertion; logs and the fixture remain at
`.git/release-state/validation-failures/20261008T172821Z-3674222-0-ci.log` and
`/tmp/jobs-release-tooling.KU6QTX`. The failure was reproduced with
`LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`: locale-sensitive sorting disagreed with the expected byte
order after successful delivery to the fixture's local bare remote. The comparison
now explicitly uses the C locale, and failed fixture assertions name their source
line. The actual repository's version and tags were not changed by that failed
gate or its repair.

With the repair applied, `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 make test-release-tooling` and
`LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8 make release-verify` passed. The latter ran the full `ci`
validation target through the same nested logger path as the failed attempt;
it did not prepare metadata, commit, tag or push. The maintainer subsequently
committed the repair and completed the normal 0.1.1 release, with fresh validation
as required by the standard runner.

The corrected changelog separates the untagged initial 0.1.0 implementation from
the dated 0.1.1 delivery tooling and fixes. The 0.1.1 release date is preserved;
the documentation correction does not change package metadata, tags or the
public API/storage contract.

The selected next draft is 0.1.2 for an additive scheduler wrapper. Its release-tooling
prerequisite is implemented: fixtures read the actual workspace version for
increment, failure and publication checks instead of assuming the initial 0.1.0.
The hardcoded assumption was reproduced failing against the released 0.1.1 at
`/tmp/jobs-release-tooling.YMX527`; the revised fixtures pass with
`LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`. ShellCheck, snapshot integrity and documentation links pass.
Package metadata remains 0.1.1.

The accepted consumer requirement is a layer between application job intent and
actual due-work/wakeup selection. `Scheduler` now borrows a bounded batch of
application-owned, validated jobs. It derives the earliest pending deadline and
starts one earliest due attempt, returning its exact Running record for the
consumer to commit before executing the effect. Ties follow batch order; restored
Running/Uncertain and terminal jobs remain excluded. All transition checks stay
in `Job::start`, with errors leaving the batch unchanged and no fallthrough to
another job. Storage, payloads, handlers, global indexing and lifecycle remain
consumer-owned; the existing IC Timers adapter receives the derived deadline.
Only a batch covering the global earliest work may supply the global wakeup.

Focused Linux qualification for the working-tree wrapper passed: 18 job tests
with all features, Clippy with warnings denied, rustdoc and both examples,
native/Wasm compilation at Rust 1.85 core / Rust 1.88 timers, verified all-feature
packaging, and the runnable persistence/recovery example. Current-version release
fixtures passed under `LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8`; declaration, snapshot, formatting and
documentation checks passed. The complete CI/release gate and live IC/native
macOS qualification were not run for this scheduler batch. There are no dependency,
MSRV, durable-record or existing public API changes; 0.1.2 remains the compatible
pending release. No commit, release, tag push or upload was made for this work.
